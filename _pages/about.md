Hello! I am a Staff Engineer at [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com).

I recieved Ph.D. from the Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence at Seoul National University, where I worked under the supervision of [Ernest K. Ryu](https://ernestryu.com/). Prior to that, I recieved M.S. in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Seoul National University and B.S. in Mathematics Education at Dankook University.

Also, I worked as a research intern at [NAVER AI Lab](https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/teams/clova-cic/ai-lab) and [KRAFTON AI](https://www.krafton.ai/en).
